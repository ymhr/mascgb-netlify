Grooming helps with the over all health of your dog plus keeps their skin in good condition. While grooming you can notice skin problems, ticks/fleas and any health changes in your dog.

Weekly brushing will remove loose hair, mats and foreign matter from the coat.

There are two types of hair in each hair follicle on a dog. The undercoat known also as the secondary hair and the guard hair known also as the primary hair. Always comb or brush the direction the coat grows. There are several types of brushes you can use.

This undercoat rake/comb is good for when your dog is "blowing coat". It helps to spritz your dog with a special de-matting spray or diluted conditioner before you start brushing. The hair will not float around and it works as a de-tangler.

With the proper tools and a trained dog, grooming can be easy and enjoyable for you and your dog. Your dog will feel better and you will enjoy living with a clean dog.
