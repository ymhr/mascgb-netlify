# Basileas Miniature American Shepherds

Based on the Surrey/Hampshire border

Specialised in raising healthy, well socialized and active puppies. Basilea pups succeed in Agility, Flyball, Obedience and Pets as Therapy dogs as well as being perfect little companions. “Little Moons Yana of Basliea” starred in the opening credits of ITVs Grantchester series. Their dogs Yana and Bliss have also competed at Crufts main arena in 2015 & 2019. Basilea puppies have made breed history several times having qualified for all top Agility Finals in the UK incl Crufts & Olympia, 2nd place at European Open, several Agility CC ticket holders, first UK bred Show Champion as well as the first ever Miniature American Shepherd Agility Champion in the UK.

# Papikoi Miniature American Shepherds

Based in Shropshire

Our dogs are first and foremost family pets, we do breed periodically and this information can be found on our 'Litter Plans' page. We compete in agility with our dogs which can take up most of our weekends. Obedience is vital in a multi dog household, so all of my dogs have achieved their Kennel Club Good Citizen Awards (Gold) and practice their obedience on a daily basis. We holiday with our dogs and have invested in a touring caravan which makes it so much easier to take the pack away with us. Mostly though, we are camped in the middle of a field at an agility show!

I currently feed my dogs on a raw diet, puppies are raised on both raw and kibble so that new owners can choose their diet of choice. I also follow the ‘puppy culture’ programme of sensory, stimulatory enrichment and socialisation.

# Starrytails Miniature American Shepherds

Based in Staffordshire

Starrytails had their first litter in March 2014 and are looking forward to seeing these puppies excel in agility and obedience. Their MAS Penny qualified into Grade 7 for Agility and lives in the family home with them and Ladybird from their first litter. They recently have been joined by a US import MAS called Ava. Puppies are raised in the home with a programme of sensory and stimulatory enrichment and socialisation.
