> Since the launch of the Kennel Club's nation-wide training programme in 1992 for dogs and their owners, the Good Citizen Dog Scheme has become an outstanding success.
>
> Over 52,000 dogs have successfully passed the test which is administered through 1,050 training organisations.
>
> The Scheme brings together simple exercises such as basic dog training, grooming, exercise, diet, cleaning up after the dog and general healthcare. All dogs are eligible for Good Citizen training, be they pedigree or cross-breed, young or old.
>
> The Scheme which is not competitive incorporates four awards - BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD and Puppy Foundation Assesment. Each level involves a gradual development in our understanding of dogs.
>
> Recently a MAS took part in a KCGC Gold Display Team at Crufts 2015.
