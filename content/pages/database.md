The Club holds a pedigree database of all MAS in the UK as well as a large number of dogs worldwide and has extensive information on ancestors and known health information, where it is available.

If you would like to contribute information, especially about health conditions and any BVA and DNA testing results to facilitate informed future breeding plans or enquiries about any background pedigree data, please contact our Database Administrator: Fran Albisser
