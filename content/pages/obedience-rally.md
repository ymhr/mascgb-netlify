# Obedience

Competitive Obedience is exactly what you would imagine - obedient and well trained dogs having their abilities tested. ï»¿The first step to having an obedient dog is to take it to training, and there is no better place to start than at a Kennel Club registered dog training club or listed status club.

After working a basic dog obedience course, such as the Good Citizen Dog Scheme, you may want to try your hand at more advanced obedience training, and in due course test your progress by entering your dog in an Obedience competition at one of the hundreds of Obedience Shows held across the UK throughout the year.

Dog training clubs are usually very sociable, where groups of like-minded people meet on a regular basis, and get great enjoyment in training their pets. Most clubs will have a cross-section of breeds (including crossbreeds) and will welcome all standards of handlers and dogs to be trained.

# Rally

Rally is the very latest dog sport to be recognised by the Kennel Club. It's fun and no matter what level you and your dog may be at it's easy to get involved and start training and competing.

Rally involves you and your dog working as a team to navigate a course with numbered signs indicating different exercises to perform; think of it as a sort of 'obedience exercise obstacle course' including simple exercises.

The course is set by the judge or trainer. There is no pause between exercises - you and your dog work briskly through the course without direction from the judge. You are encouraged to talk to and praise your dog during the performance. Any dog can get involved; your dog does not have to be a pedigree dog to take part, but if you want to compete it must be registered with the Kennel Club on either the Breed Register or the Activity Register.
