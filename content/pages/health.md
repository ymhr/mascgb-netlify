## Frequently Asked Questions

Does A Merle Coloured MAS have more health problems?

There is a common misconception that merles have more health problems which has stemmed from the fact that there in an inherited risk with accidental merle to merle breedings, as opposed to a merle to non-merle breeding.

Is there any documentation I should ask a breeder for regarding DNA tests?

A MAS breeder should be willing and able to show you copies of results from DNA tests, eye exams, hip and elbow screening reports.  If you are looking at a specific litter and the breeder does not own the sire, he should have a copy of the dogâ€™s certificates or be willing to get them for you.

Do MAS with Blue Eyes have eye issues?

Blue eyes are not more susceptible to eye defects and disease but they are more sensitive to bright light (as they are in blue-eyed people.)  There is no clear association of blue eyes to deafness in MAS, deaf MAS virtually always have too much white or are double merle.
